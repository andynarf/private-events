# PROJECT: ASSOCIATIONS from Microverse
From the Microverse Ruby on rails curriculum
Following [this link](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations) from The Odin Project 

In these projects, you’ll finally really get to dive into ActiveRecord’s associations, one of the best features it offers. The tutorial chapter will have you creating microposts for your users and the other project will give you a chance to add some more interesting associations to your previous work.

## Installation
1. git clone url
2. cd private-events
3. bundle install
4. rails server
